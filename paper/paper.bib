abstract = {A comprehensive study on the influence of planar fourth-order fiber orientation tensors on effective linear elastic stiffnesses predicted by orientation averaging mean field homogenization is given. Fiber orientation states of sheet molding compound (SMC) are identified to be in most cases approximately planar. In the planar case, all possible fourth-order fiber orientation tensors are given by a minimal invariant set of structurally differing planar fourth-order fiber orientation tensors. This set defines a three-dimensional body and forms the basis for a comprehensive study on the influence of a fiber orientation distribution in terms of a fourth-order tensor on homogenized stiffnesses. The methodology of this study is the main contribution of this work and can be adopted to analyze the orientation dependence of any quantity which is a function of a planar fourth-order fiber orientation tensor. At specific points inside the set of planar fiber orientation tensors, effective stiffnesses are calculated with selected mean field homogenization schemes. These schemes are based on orientation averaging of transversely isotropic elasticity tensors following Advani and Tucker (1987), which is explicitly recast as linear invariant composition in the fiber orientation tensors of second and fourth order of Kanatani third kind. A maximum entropy reconstruction of a fiber orientation distribution function based on leading fiber orientation tensors, enables a new numerical formulation of the Advani and Tucker average for the special planar case. Polar plots of Young’s modulus and generalized bulk modulus obtained by selected homogenization schemes are arranged on two-dimensional slices within the body of admissible fiber orientation tensors, visualizing the influence of the orientation tensor on the stiffness tensor. The orientation-dependence of the generalized bulk modulus differs significantly between selected homogenizations. Restrictions on the effective anisotropic material response caused by orthotropy of closure approximations are discussed.}

abstract = {Having noted an important role of image stress in work hardening of dispersion hardened materials, (1,3) the present paper discusses a method of calculating the average internal stress in the matrix of a material containing inclusions with transformation strain. It is shown that the average stress in the matrix is uniform throughout the material and independent of the position of the domain where the average treatment is carried out. It is also shown that the actual stress in the matrix is the average stress plus the locally fluctuating stress, the average of which vanishes in the matrix. Average elastic energy is also considered by taking into account the effects of the interaction among the inclusions and of the presence of the free boundary.
Résumé
Ayant remarqué que la force image joue un rôle important dans la consolidation des matériaux durcis par dispersion, les auteurs proposent ici une méthode de calcul de la contrainte interne moyenne dans la matrice d'un matériau contenant des inclusions présentant des déformations dues à une transformation, et montrent que la contrainte moyenne dans la matrice est uniforme à travers le matériau et indépendante de la position de la zone dans laquelle le traitement moyen est effectué. Ils montrent aussi que la contrainte réelle dans la matrice est égale à la somme de la contrainte moyenne et de la contrainte locale variable dont la moyenne pour toute la matrice tend vers zéro. L'énergie élastique moyenne est également calculée en tenant compte des effets d'interaction entre les inclusions et de la présence du joint libre.
Zusammenfassung
Nachdem die groβe Bedeutung der Bildkraft für die Verfestigung von dispersions gehärteten Materialien(1,3) betont wurde, diskutiert die vorliegende Arbeit eine Methode zur Beschreibung der mittleren inneren Spannung in der Matrix eines Materials, das Einschlüsse mit Umwandlungsverspannungen enthält, Es wird gezeigt, daβ die mittlere Spannung in der Matrix im ganzen Material gleichförmig und unabhängig von der Lage des Bereichs ist, für den die Behandlung durchgeführt wurde. Auβerdem wird gezeigt, daβ die aktuelle Spannung in der Matrix gleich der mittleren Spannung plus einer lokal fluktuierenden Spannung ist, deren Mittelwert über die gesamte Matrix verschwindet. Die mittlere elastische Energie wird ebenfalls diskutiert unter Berücksichtigung der Wechselwirkungseffekte zwischen den Einschlüssen und der Gegenwart der freien Oberfläche.}

abstract = {The micromechanics of composites with multiple phases of different shapes embedded into a matrix phase, typically requires symmetrization strategies for their homogenized elasticity tensors, in particular so if the popular Mori–Tanaka estimate is employed. We here explore the implications of such symmetrization techniques, on the concentrations tensors, i.e. on the relations between macroscopic strains imposed onto a representative volume element of microelastic matter, and the microscopic phase strains developing across the materials’ microstructure. Thereby, we adopt the important idea of Mori and Tanaka to approximate the phase strains by the homogeneous strains inside an Eshelbian inhomogeneity embedded into an infinite matrix, together with the phase strains fulfilling the strain average rule; while we refrain from the identification of the strain in the matrix phase as the auxiliary strain imposed remotely at the infinite matrix of Eshelby’s matrix-inhomogeneity problem. Instead of this identification, we allow for a general multilinear relation between auxiliary strains and RVE-related macroscopic strains, and we express the homogenized stiffness as (i) a function of the conversion tensor quantifying the aforementioned multilinear relation, and (ii) as the symmetrized Mori–Tanaka estimate. In this way, the conversion tensor and all phase concentration tensors can be determined in a way which allows the overall elastic stiffness to remain symmetric. This is illustrated by means of two benchmark examples concerning matrix–inclusion composites hosting both spherical and prolate inclusions, with the matrices being isotropic and transversely isotropic, respectively. These examples benefit from analytical expressions for the Hill tensor governing the underlying matrix-inhomogeneity problems.}
